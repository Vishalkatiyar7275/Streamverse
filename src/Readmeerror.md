🧾 Documentation: Express App Initialization Error
🔴 Scenario 1: You used both
```
import { app } from "./app.js"; // ✅ correct import
const app = express();          // ❌ re-declared!
```
🔍 What Happened?
You imported a fully configured app instance from app.js

But then you overwrote it immediately with const app = express();

This means:

All routes defined in app.js are lost

All middlewares like cors, cookieParser, express.json() are lost

The app starts, but nothing works → all routes give 404 or Cannot GET

⚠️ Error Explanation
Issue	Description
app overwritten	The imported app is replaced with a blank instance
Routes not found	Since the new app has no routes, all requests fail
Middleware missing	Your server doesn't parse JSON, CORS fails, cookies missing

✅ Solution for Scenario 1
Do not re-declare app. Just use the one imported:


```
import { app } from "./app.js"; // keep this
// ❌ remove: const app = express();
```
🟠 Scenario 2: You only used


```
const app = express();
```
🔍 What Happened?
You initialized a raw Express app without importing your pre-configured version

But forgot to:

Attach middlewares

Declare routes (like /api/v1/users/register)

Add cookieParser, CORS, etc.

⚠️ Error Explanation
Issue	Description
No middleware	req.body will be undefined, CORS may fail
No route handlers	API endpoints like /api/v1/users/register won’t work
Basic server	You’ll only get “Cannot GET /” unless you define routes manually

✅ Solution for Scenario 2
If you want to keep everything in index.js, make sure to:

Manually add middlewares

Manually register routes

But best practice is to move this into app.js, then import it like this:
```
// index.js
import { app } from "./app.js";
```
